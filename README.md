Real Estate ROI Prediction using Random Forest Regressor
This repository contains Python code to predict the Return on Investment (ROI) for real estate properties using a Random Forest Regressor model.

Overview
The goal is to utilize several property-related variables, like location score, square footage, age of the property, vacancy rate, etc., to predict the ROI for a given property. This can help real estate investors make informed decisions.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Scikit-learn
Pandas
You can install the required packages using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Prepare your data in a CSV format similar to the example CSV included (real_estate_data.csv).
Run the main script predict_roi.py using Python.

python predict_roi.py

Code Structure
Data Preprocessing: The data is scaled using StandardScaler from scikit-learn.
Train-Test Split: The data is split into a training set and a test set (80-20 split).
Model: Random Forest Regressor model is trained on the training set.
Evaluation: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

Variables Used
Location_Score: The quality score of the property's location.
Square_Footage: Total area of the property.
Age_of_Property: The age of the property in years.
Vacancy_Rate: Current vacancy rate in the property.
Market_Growth: Projected growth in the property market.
Interest_Rate: Current interest rates for real estate loans.
Property_Tax: Property tax rates applicable to the property.
Operating_Expenses: Yearly expenses required to maintain the property.
Net_Operating_Income: Yearly income generated by the property after expenses.
Price: The current price of the property.
The target variable is ROI, which represents the Return on Investment.
