# Real Estate ROI Prediction in Python 🏡

## Description 📝

This repository contains Python code designed to predict the Return on Investment (ROI) for real estate properties using machine learning algorithms. Specifically, it utilizes the `sklearn` library for the Random Forest algorithm.

## Files 📂

- `main.py` : Contains the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

## Features 🌟

The model takes into consideration the following features:

- **Location Score**
- **Square Footage**
- **Age of Property**
- **Vacancy Rate**
- **Market Growth**
- **Interest Rate**
- **Property Tax**
- **Operating Expenses**
- **Net Operating Income**
- **Price**

The target variable is **ROI (Return on Investment)**.

## How to Run 🚀

1. **Clone** this repository.
2. **Navigate** to the directory where the repository is cloned.
3. **Run** `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` depending on your setup.

## Output 📊

The output will display the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for the Random Forest model on the test set, giving an indication of the model's performance.
